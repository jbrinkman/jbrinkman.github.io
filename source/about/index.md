# Me

In 1980 a friend let me use his BASIC programming book for the TRS-80 Model III. That first introduction to programming was the start of my journey in software development.

# Myself

In 2003 I started TAG Software in order to pursue my passion for DNN. TAG Software was the first of two companies I founded, and it started me on my journey as an entreprenuer.

# And I

In 2006 I turned my first bowl on ShopSmith lathe. I spent many years sharing my love of woodturning with my Father-in-law until he passed away in 2015. Although I can no longer share my love of turning with my him, my creative journey continues.
