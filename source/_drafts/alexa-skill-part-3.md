## Overview

_[GUI]: Graphical User Interface
_[VUI]: Voice User Interface
_[NLP]: Natural Language Processing
_[ASR]: Automatic Speech Recognition
Every decade or two since the advent of computers, there has been a revolutionary product that fundamentally alters the computing landscape and creates massive new business opportunities. In the 70s this revolution was led by the creation of personal computers and the Apple II, Commodore PET and Tandy TRS-80. In the 80s we saw whole new businesses created as the result of the revolution brought about by the GUI as exemplified by the Mac OS and Windows. In the 90s some of the largest companies in the world were started based on the creation of the World Wide Web and Netscape Navigator. In 2007 the modern mobile computing era was fueled by the creation of touch based devices and the Apple iPhone. In late 2014, Amazon launched a device which I believe marked the start of another innovation wave.

In this series I'll provide some background on the current state of the industry and walk through creating the sample voice application that we used to demonstrate the API capabilities of Evoq Liquid Content. While the code will be specific to Amazon Alexa and Evoq, the concepts are exactly the same regardless of whether you are creating applications for Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant or Microsoft Cortana.
