I detailed my blogging solution in the post Serverless Blogging. Having written hundreds of blog posts over the last 20 years, I have a good sense of those features that I rely on, and those that I don‚Äôt find very important for my needs. I used to believe that content management systems were great platforms for building blogs, but the reality is, blog content is fairly static. Once written, a blog really shouldn‚Äôt change except for rare occurances where you need to fix typos or to correct mis-statements. Picking a Site GeneratorMost static site generators require some level of coding skills in order to build or enhance the themes used for your site. Themes control aspects like when to show content in the sidebar, the colors and styles used on the site, how the navigation will work, etc. Anything having to do with the look and feel of the site is likely defined by the theme. If you want to have page elements that are interactive or that change from page to page, that will likely require some type of coding. When I originally relaunched my blog, I was just coming off of 15 years of writing software using .Net in both VB and C#. Choosing a platform based on .Net was a natural fit as I felt very comfortable with my ability to maintain and enhance the platform as needed. Wyam was a popular open source .Net based static site generator at the time. I felt very comfortable jumping in and figuring out how it worked and how to extend the platform as needed to suit my needs. In the last 5 years my life has changed substantially and for the past year I have spent most of my time writing code in NodeJS. Wyam is no longer a fully open source platform with the newest .Net core version transitioning to a paid licensing model. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to find a stable NodeJS based platform. I wanted to be able to keep the little bit of content I had created in Wyam so finding a generator that supported Markdown was high on my list of features. After a short search I have settled on Hexo as my new platform of choice. My content is still written in Markdown, so I can use pretty much any editor I choose (including the built in file editor on GitHub). Translating the old content from Wyam was just a matter of updating the front-matter for the blog posts. I didn‚Äôt have a lot of content and didn‚Äôt really care about maintaining URL format so the migration was fairly easy. Leave a CommentAs before, I decided to continue using Utteranc.es, which works very well for my needs. All of my comments live in ‚Äúissues‚Äù and are maintained by GitHub. I can trust their infrastructure to handle the basics, and if needed, I have full access to their API to write my own bots to screen out problematic comments or handle other comment management chores. This provides me a lot of flexibility and control over the comments and the commenting system. Utteranc.es is not supported out of the box, but litteraly was just a couple of lines of code in the theme, and one configuration file change to support this commenting system. Performance and SecurityIn 2017, GitHub did not have all of the features that it has today. GitHub Pages could host and serve static pages, but you didn‚Äôt have control over the site URL&#x2F;domain, and you didn‚Äôt have the ability to serve pages via SSL&#x2F;TLS. To solve this problem, I used CloudFlare as a proxy for my GitHub hosted pages which provided me the ability to use a custom domain and to serve pages with HTTPS: instead of just HTTP:. Since then, GitHub has addressed these two deficiencies with GitHub Pages. I now have multiple options on how to configure Pages to use a domain of my choosing and to serve the content securely. These features have allowed me to drop CloudFlare from my site architecture which means I have one less piece of infrastructure I have to deal with. This lets me keep more of my process on GitHub which simplifies the overall architecture of the site. PublishingPublishing my blog posts follows a similar workflow as it did when using Wyam. I write my blog post locally as markdown. Once my post is complete and everything looks good on my machine, I just check-in my new markdown file and any associated images. Previously, I had been using AppVeyor to monitor GitHub and to run the ‚Äúpublishing‚Äù step in Wyam whenever new files were added to the repository. Wyam would convert the markdown, images and use my configured theme to generate the final static site. The AppVeyor scripts would then check-in these files into the GitHub-pages branch of the repository which is what would actually get served to anyone coming to my site. In October of 2018, GitHub launched GitHub Actions which is a full automation system capable of handling almost any CI&#x2F;CD requirements. Once again, I found another part of my site hosting services that I could migrate to GitHub infrastructure and remove one more external service from the mix. GitHub actions are written in a fairly standard YAML format which is comparable to many of the other CI&#x2F;CD systems I have worked with. 1234567891011121314151617181920212223242526272829303132333435name: Pageson: push: branches: - main # default branchjobs: pages: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - uses: actions/checkout@v2 with: submodules: recursive - name: Use Node.js 16.x uses: actions/setup-node@v2 with: node-version: \"16\" - name: Cache NPM dependencies uses: actions/cache@v2 with: path: node_modules key: ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache restore-keys: | ${{ runner.OS }}-npm-cache - name: Install Dependencies run: npm install - name: Build run: npm run build - name: Deploy uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 with: github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} publish_dir: ./public Wrapping it UpOverall, I am very happy with the new platform. Like all software, there is a bit of a learning curve to get up and running. Once it is working, writing new blogs is pretty painless. Like Wyam before it, Hexo provides me a lot of flexibility to customize the system the way I like. I have full access to the source code and it has a nice plugin ecosystem so I don‚Äôt feel I have to write every extension myself. I enjoy blogging and the process of learning that blogging forces you to do in order to write a well thought out article. Part of the challenge is to just rebuild the habit that I built during more than 15 years of open source development. This post is just the latest brick in that rebuilding effort. Whether you are new to blogging, or have taken an extended break, I encourage you to go out and give it a try.

It is not so much climbing a ladder as it is rock climbing journey. Sometimes you progress straight up the face with ease. Sometimes you must sit in place for a while to ponder your next move. And occassionally you may need to retreat or move laterally to find a new approach to continue your climb. In some rare instances, you determine that the cliff you are on, is not the one you want to climb and you go in search of a different cliff or rock wall. This is the story of the last 5 years of my ongoing rock climbing career adventure. In 2017 I left DNN after having worked on that project for almost 15 years. It was a great part of my career and I enjoyed the technology and the people I got to work with during that time. In 2018 and 2019, I bounced between a couple of different companies and projects. I could not seem to find the right fit. Either personalities, or culture, or pay was not a match for what I was looking for. For the first time in 23 years I was having difficulty finding a position that suited my skills and that was engaging. In the summer of 2019, Scott Willhite (one of my DNN co-founders) introduced me to a small consulting firm out of Dallas named Code Authority. They needed some DNN expertise for a project they were working on. What started as a small 45 day, 2 person project, blossomed into a 10+ person development team for a multi-year custom CRM development effort. My short consulting gig turned into a full-time job leading an awesome hand-picked group of developers. My managers at Code Authority were very supportive and helped me build a team of energetic and highly skilled developers who were passionate about their jobs. In October of that year, Improving acquired Code Authority, and we were all introduced to a company that seeks to change the perception of IT within the business world: a company focused on building a culture of trust. This acquisition started a new journey as I went from working in a small consulting firm of about 50 people, to eventually working in a 1500 person consulting company that is still growing rapidly. It has been an amazing three years working for Improving Frisco (formerly Code Authority) where I made some great friendships in David Schwartz and Bryan Crawford, and been supported by leaders like Tim Rayburn, Kevin Baker, David O‚ÄôHara, and Jason W. Taylor. In January of this year, Improving Frisco and Improving Dallas merged and we began integrating our operations and figuring out our new roles within this larger Improving Enterprise. In March, my journey as a Principal Consultant at Improving Dallas ended and I transfered to Improving Ohio. This move made a lot of sense as I have been living in Ohio throughout my tenure at Code Authority&#x2F;Improving and working with the Ohio team was a natural fit. It has been a wild 3 years, with lots of ups and a few downs, but rewarding nonetheless. I miss working daily with the Dallas Improvers but enjoy my new teams and coworkers in Ohio. On April 1, I started my new journey as a Director of Consulting at Improving Ohio, and I couldn‚Äôt be happier to be able to remain in the Improving family and get to help a new team continue growing and thriving. In addition to managing a team of just under a dozen developers, I am able to continue actively working with customers to architect and develop new software systems. And, as I have done throughout my career. My story is not all that important to anyone but me. What is important, is understanding that your career path will be different and unique to you. Fix a goal in mind and keep working towards that goal, knowing that there will be adjustments along the way. Make new friends and acquaintances, and build your professional network, as you never know who it is that is going to help you secure the next foothold. Every job I have landed since 1997 has been the direct result of an introduction made by a friend, or a relationship I cultivated over several years. My adventure is far from complete. I still have a lot of climbing remaining. But along the way, I am enjoying the journey, and finding time to make new friends and spend time with my family.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Career","slug":"Career","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Career/"},{"name":"Improving","slug":"Improving","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Improving/"}]},{"title":"The Accidental Geek: My Next Great Adventure Begins at Auth0","slug":"my-next-great-adventure","date":"2018-03-22T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-10-26T03:23:48.101Z","comments":true,"path":"2018/03/22/my-next-great-adventure/","link":"","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/2018/03/22/my-next-great-adventure/","excerpt":"Spring is a great time of year.

The trees are starting to bud, the flowers are beginning to bloom and the grass is greener than ever. Spring represents a time of renewal and rebirth, and so it is fitting that this week I began my next great adventure. After 11 years of working at DNN and 15 years since I started work on the DNN open source project, it feels awesome to start work on something completely new. This past Monday was my first day at Auth0 as a Product Manager on the Auth0 Appliance team, and I‚Äôm really excited about the opportunity. Auth0 is a global leader in the Identity as a Service (IDaaS) market and has been growing at an incredible pace since it‚Äôs founding in 2013. Auth0‚Äôs products make it simple to implement robust and secure authentication for your app in just a few minutes, while also providing complete control over authentication flows and UI for customers with more complex requirements. While Auth0 has made a name for itself in the developer community, what I am most impressed by is the strong culture that has been created at the company. Policies like remote working, unlimited vacation, generous pay and benefits, and annual company-wide off-sites are great, but it is the ‚ÄúNo BAP‚Äù and radical transparency value statements that really resonate with me. No BAP means ‚ÄúNo Bullsh*t, No A$$holes and No Politics‚Äù and is something that is taken very seriously. People here are very open and direct, and they expect you to be as well. Even on the first day, company execs openly discussed company financials with all of the new hires (regardless of their role), information that is closely held at many other companies. While I was interviewing, I looked at the company reviews on GlassDoor and it is the first 5.0 company I‚Äôve seen. With over 300 employees and 21 reviews that is impressive. It is obvious that Auth0 is not your average company. Auth0 is primarily delivered as a SaaS product and it strives to make adding authentication to your application as easy as possible. However, some companies have more stringent data security requirements and need a more isolated environment or an environment in a specific geo-location. For those companies we offer a Private SaaS Appliance solution that can be hosted in our cloud, your cloud or in your datacenter. The appliance is a managed service that is installed, monitored and managed by the Auth0 team. The Auth0 appliance team is responsible for taking our multi-tenant solutions and packaging them up for easy deployment and configuration in the environment of your choice. This is the first time in over 20 years that I have not been a part of a company‚Äôs management team, and in some respects I am looking forward to that. This is about working on a team with a lot of people that I respect and can learn from and about strengthening my own product management skills. I heard a quote this week that I feel sums it up quite nicely ‚ÄúIf someone offers you a ride on a rocket ship, don‚Äôt worry about whether you have an aisle or a window seat.‚Äù Well, I‚Äôm all strapped in and ready to see where this ride ends up.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Career","slug":"Career","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Career/"},{"name":"Auth0","slug":"Auth0","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Auth0/"}]},{"title":"Serverless Blogging","slug":"serverless-blogs","date":"2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-10-26T03:23:48.109Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/10/18/serverless-blogs/","link":"","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/2017/10/18/serverless-blogs/","excerpt":"Serverless computing is all the rage today.

Services like AWS Lambda and Azure Functions allow you to build applications without worrying about where your code runs or when to scale up and down the resources for your application. While there is a server somewhere that is running your code, you don‚Äôt have to worry about it. All of the server management details are handled for you and you can focus your effort on just your code. Evaluating My OptionsAs I was evaluating different blogging options I shortlisted the features I wanted: Blogging - must support blogging (posting, commenting, RSS) Full Control - can change any aspect I choose Low maintenance - operates with little to no intervention Lightweight - doesn‚Äôt have hundreds of unneeded features Flexible - the system could be extended if needed. Bonus points if I had the knowledge to create extensions. Scalable - should be easy to host and handle almost unlimited load In evaluating systems I looked at three different types of systems. CMS platforms like DNN, Drupal and Wordpress are generally very flexible and scalable systems that could easily handle my blogging needs. The one area where these tools fall short is that they all have hundreds of features that overkill if you are just looking for a blog. Each of these features steals CPU cycles and creates a potential security risk. This results in needing higher end hosting resources which means I would be spending more time on maintaining the system rather than focusing on the blog. As anyone who has ever had to drop everything to upgrade their site due to a security issue knows, this is not an insignificant issue. The second set of systems I looked at are dedicated blogging platforms. In recent years, the number of blogging platforms has been shrinking. The only real option that I see today is Ghost or Medium. While both of these are well established options I didn‚Äôt feel that I would have the necessary control if I went with Medium and I felt like the maintenance costs for Ghost would still be a bit high. The final set of systems I considered were static site generators. Site generators are interesting to me since they ultimately just aid in creating static HTML sites. HTML sites are about as scalable as you can get since all of the content can be cached and there is no server processing needed to serve the content. With some of the hosting options available, I could serve up the site for almost no cost. Most of the site generators I evaluated supported extensible generation pipelines and some sort of markdown or scripting language for controlling the visual aspects of the site. The site generation option ticked off every feature on my wish list. Picking a Site GeneratorA couple years ago, Phil Haack began hosting his blog on GitHub. This really intrigued me. By hosting on GitHub, Phil completely eliminated his maintenance efforts. GitHub serves up millions of pageviews every day so my few page views won‚Äôt even be noticed. Even a twitter mention by Scott Hanselman won‚Äôt be enough to swamp my blog with traffic. GitHub definitely looked like a good, albeit unusual, hosting option. And it is totally free which means that the wife acceptance factor is very high. There are many great static site generators to choose from. I knew that there would be one that was just right for my purposes. The GitHub Pages feature that I would be leveraging to host my blog is nice. It includes full support for Jekyll, a very popular static site generator. Unfortunately, Jekyll is written in Ruby. While that was not a deal killer, it added a bit of friction to getting started, and would potentially complicate things whenever I wanted to extend the platform. I had previous experience building a site in Sphinx and Python, and I learned the hard way that learning a new language and a new tool is a big task that complicates the site building process. I have worked in many different programming languages, but Ruby is not one of them so I wanted to avoid Jekyll for this project if I could. After exploring a handful of different static generators, I finally settled on Wyam as being the best fit for me. Not only is it written in .Net (C#), the project appears to be actively maintained and the author is very responsive to questions on Gitter. Wyam is very similar to most generators I evaluated. It includes support for creating my own themes. In Wyam Themes are built using Razor Pages. This allows me to use all of my ASP.Net skills for hand-crafting my own custom theme. Although Wyam includes five different built-in themes out of the box, I much prefer to craft my own theme so that my site reflects my personal tastes. On the content side Wyam includes standard support for creating my pages with markdown. This makes it easy to create content without a lot of fuss. When I need a little more control over the final markup, I can always create my pages using Razor script. This gives me the full power of HTML and C# so I can get as fancy as I want for those few pages where the extra control may be necessary. All document generation in Wyam is the result of running a set of input files through a number of pre-written pipelines. These pipelines take the input files and generate the HTML, CSS and JavaScript for my final site. In Wyam these pipelines are called recipes. Out of the box there are recipes for Blogs, BookSites and Documentation Sites. With support for markdown, Razor, LESS, SASS, JSON and YAML, I have just about everything I need to create beautiful sites. Of course, if the built-in recipes don‚Äôt suit my needs, I can easily craft my own or customize the pre-built recipes to suit my particular needs. If desired I could easily extend Wyam to include support for Liquid markup, add support for frontmatter written in XML or any number of interesting customizations. I am in complete control, and I don‚Äôt have to make any changes to the core Wyam platform to make these enhancements. That is exactly the kind of control that I was looking for. Just a Few CommentsThe heart of the blogging experience focuses on publishing articles. This is a task that any decent static site generator can handle with ease. But a blog is about more than just publishing articles. It is about engaging in a conversation with your readers. It is about expressing your views, sharing your knowledge and then interacting with your readers to get their viewpoint. Commenting then becomes the soul of your blog. It is where your ideas meet the real world and are challenged or confirmed. Ten years ago, commenting systems were fully integrated into blogging platforms. If you didn‚Äôt like the comment management features of your blog platform, then your only option was to change platforms. Today there are a number of great commenting options for blogs. Disqus and Facebook are two of the largest commenting systems out there. They are easy to integrate and they can handle whatever load you throw at them. I like both of these options but whatever reason, they just didn‚Äôt resonate with me. When I looked at Utteranc.es, I was intrigued. Utteranc.es uses the GitHub API to integrate the GitHub issue comment system into your blog. When the first comment is posted to a specific post, Utteranc.es creates a new issue in your predefined GitHub repository, and adds the comment to the issue. Each blog post will have an associated GitHub issue. Since I was planning to use GitHub to host my site source code and to serve up the blog from GitHub pages, it just seemed a natural fit to also use GitHub for hosting the comments for the blog. And as an added bonus, it is completely free. Performance and SecurityIn today‚Äôs web environment it is important to consider the performance and security aspects of running your site. Since GitHub is handling all of the hosting duties for my site, I am fairly confident that I won‚Äôt have any issues with scaling. One of the downsides of using GitHub for hosting my blog is that GitHub does not offer SSL suport for serving GitHub pages with a custom domain. Fortunately, this is easily remedied by using CloudFlare. Not only will this add SSL support, but it also means that all of my content is served from a CDN. Other than comments, the site is purely static content so I can be very aggressive with caching. The comments are loaded using JavaScript so it should be unaffected by the caching. CloudFlare offers a lot of additional features, but for basic CDN and SSL needs CloudFlare offers a free plan for non-commercial use. PublishingSince Wyam is a static site generator, I will need to run Wyam after every blog post is completed. That complicate the process of publishing my blog. Fortunately for me, there are many continuous integration systems that integrate with GitHub. Many of the most popular CI systems run on Linux and won‚Äôt work for this project. AppVeyor is a popular CI tool that works great for .Net projects. Wyam has great documentation showing how to use AppVeyor with Wyam and GitHub. As you might have guessed, AppVeyor has a free plan that works well for my needs. Wrapping it UpI don‚Äôt know how many servers are involved in running my site, and honestly I don‚Äôt really care, and really that is the whole point of serverless computing. I can focus on writing my blog without worrying about any of the hosting concerns. This blogging approach is not for everyone. Wyam, GitHub, Utteranc.es, AppVeyor and CloudFlare are not going to suddenly supplant WordPress as the leading blogging platform. I am just getting started with this new system and I expect that in time I will find new features that I would like to add to my site. I am confident that Wyam is flexible enough to grow with my needs. And the best part of this whole configuration is that I am able to run a secure, high performance blog site for free.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"GitHub","slug":"GitHub","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/GitHub/"},{"name":"Serverless","slug":"Serverless","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Serverless/"},{"name":"Blog","slug":"Blog","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Blog/"}]},{"title":"The Accidental Geek: A New Beginning","slug":"a-new-beginning","date":"2017-10-14T00:00:00.000Z","updated":"2022-10-26T03:23:48.097Z","comments":true,"path":"2017/10/14/a-new-beginning/","link":"","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/2017/10/14/a-new-beginning/","excerpt":"In February 2003, I created a new website under the name ‚ÄúThe Accidental Geek‚Äù.

This site was built using a new web application framework called IBuySpy Workshop and was a place where I could blog about my technology passions. I never intended to become a geek, but I fell in love with electronics as a young kid, and later moved into programming as computers became more accessible. The name seemed to fit: and the domain was available. As many of you know, IbuySpy Workshop became DotNetNuke, which later became DNN. When I started using IBuySpy Workshop, I immediately fell in love with the possibilities. Within just a couple months I quit my job and started TAG Software, a development company focused on this new framework. For the next two years, I spent all my spare time contibuting code to the DotNetNuke project, some of which is still in DNN today. I was never really able to get TAG Software off the ground as I got sucked back into my previous company to help launch a new J2EE dev framework. Even with the shuttering of TAG Software, DNN was still my passion and I continued to work on it in whatever spare time I had available. In 2005 myself and the other leaders of the DNN project decided it was time to focus more resources on DNN so I quit my job once again. Over the next year Shaun Walker, Scott Willhite, Nik Kalyani and myself worked to shutdown our other businesses and begin focusing all of our efforts on managing and growing the project. In September of 2006 we officially incorporated our new company - DotNetNuke Corp. Since those early days, I have been 100% focused on building and promoting DNN and DNN Corp. This project has been my passion for almost 15 years and has been my full-time job for 11. Throughout my time with DNN I have shared my passion for technology and DNN with others through my blog on theaccidentalgeek.com and on DNNSoftware.com, and have taken my passion on the road by speaking at conferences and user groups all over the world. During my time with DNN I have worn a lot of hats and been involved in many different aspects of running a software company. I created the DNN Marketplace which was later merged with Snowcovered to become the DNN Store. I led our efforts in creating our OpenForce conferences in the US and Europe, and then managed those conferences for the first three years. I started the QA and Support teams, and worked on the original commercial versions of DNN Professional. I have managed community, been a product manager, started our foray into the cloud and led several R&amp;D projects. Somewhere in all of that I found time to co-author two books on DNN and author a third eBook on jQuery. It has been an extremely challenging and rewarding experience. This summer the DNN Corp executive team made the collective decision that now was the right time to seek an acquirer for the company. As much as we all loved the products we were building and the customers we served, we were not able to apply the financial resources to product or community development that we felt was necessary to really remain competitive in the CMS space. The best thing we could do for our employees, our customers and our community was to find a larger company who saw the potential in DNN and who was willing to invest the needed capital. In late august DNN Corp was acquired by ESW Corp which started a new chapter for DNN. As part of the acquisition, I am officially leaving DNN. The end of October will be my last official day as a DNN employee. For the first time in over 15 years, DNN will no longer be a central part of my life. Now it is time for me to seek out my next great adventure. I plan to take a couple of months off and explore some of my other passions like woodturning and to see what other great technologies I can sink my teeth into. With my upcoming 20th anniversary this November, my wife and I will finally go on the Hawaiian vacation we had originally planned for our 10th anniversary (this little conference called OpenForce kinda changed those plans). I‚Äôll still be around the DNN community for a while and plan to attend and speak at DNN Summit this winter. We‚Äôll see after that where my journey leads. If it is even half as enjoyable as my time has been with DNN then I will truly consider myself blessed.","categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"DNN","slug":"DNN","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/DNN/"},{"name":"Career","slug":"Career","permalink":"http://joe.brinkman.me/tags/Career/"}]}],"categories":[],"tags":[{"name":"Link
